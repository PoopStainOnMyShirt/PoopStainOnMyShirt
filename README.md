## 💤 About This Space (and Me)

Hey there! Welcome to my little GitHub corner. I'm Joyojhyoty, a **Software Developer** based in Bengaluru, India.

I've spent a few years (**2+ years experience**) wrangling code, mainly in the land of **C#** and the **.NET** framework (including **ASP.NET Core**). This place is where I dump my side projects, experiments, and the occasional personal mission to build something fast.

Feel free to browse around! If a project looks rough, it probably is—that's the nature of side-hustle code! 😅
